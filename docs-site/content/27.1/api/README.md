## What's new

This release fixes some bugs and performance regressions identified in [`v27.0`](../../27.0/).

The changelog below aggregates all the changes between `v27.0` and `v27.x`. Changes in this point release are highlighted with `New in v27.1`.

### New Features

- A new `text_match_type` mode called `sum_score` which sums the field-level text match scores to arrive at a document-level score.
  - This mode is helpful in cases where you need to consider a document with more matches across more weighted fields, to be more relevant.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/search.html#ranking-and-sorting-parameters)
- Enable/disable typo tolerance on alphanumeric words in the query via the 
  `enable_typos_for_alpha_numerical_tokens` search parameter. Default: `true`.
  - For eg: If you need to disable typo tolerance for a word that contains a mix of letters and numbers like `turbo100`, you can now set `enable_typos_for_alpha_numerical_tokens: false` as a search parameter.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/search.html#typo-tolerance-parameters)
- Conversation History from Conversational Searches is now stored as a regular Typesense collection.
  - This is new feature, also has a corresponding breaking change. See the `Deprecations / behavior changes` section below.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/conversational-search-rag.html#create-a-conversation-history-collection)
- Support synonyms on query prefixes and typo-corrected query tokens via the `synonym_prefix` 
  and `synonym_num_typos` parameters. 
  - Defaults to [`synonym_prefix: false`](https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/search.html#ranking-and-sorting-parameters) and [`synonym_num_typos: 0`](https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/search.html#typo-tolerance-parameters).
- Customization of faceting index used for search via the `facet_strategy` parameter.
  - By default, Typesense picks an efficient `facet_strategy` for you based on some built-heuristics. But this flag now lets you explicitly control which strategy to use: `exhaustive` or `top_values` or `automatic` (default).
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/search.html#faceting-parameters)
- Support nested reference collections (when using JOINs), in `include_fields` search parameter, Eg: `include_fields: $Collection_B(title, $Collection_A(title))`
- Support `sort_by` of nested join fields. Eg: `sort_by: $Collection_B( $Collection_A(price:asc) )`
- Ability to use JOINs when using the documents export endpoint, with the `filter_by` and `include_fields` parameters. 
- Support exact prefix value filtering via the `:=` operation. For example, given `filter_by: name:= S*`.
  we will match `Steve Jobs` but NOT `Adam Stator`.

### Enhancements

**Search Parameters:**

- Added `enable_synonyms` boolean flag to enable/disable the application of synonyms during search (default: `true`).
- Added `filter_curated_hits` search parameter which allows you to customize filter behavior for pinned hits.
- Added search parameter `enable_analytics` that prevents the given query from being used for analytics aggregation.
- Support array fields in `facet_return_parent` search parameter.
- Allow special characters in range facet labels.
- Increase max length of facet value stored to `255` characters.

**Server-side improvements:**

- Added `--filter-by-max-ops` server-side flag that can customize the maximum number of operators that can be present
  in a `filter_by` clause (default: `100`).
- Added `--max-per-page` server-side flag that increases the number of hits that can be fetched within a single page. Default: `250`.
- Allow dynamic update of cache size via the `/config` API with the `cache-num-entries` key.
- Use 64K page size for Jemalloc on ARM64 / Linux.
- Log in-flight search queries during a crash.

**AI Search:**

- Added API key support for vLLM conversation models using the `api_key` parameter
- Suppress punctuations and non-speech tokens from appearing in voice search (e.g. `hmm`).

**API Endpoints:**

- Support `include_fields` and `exclude_fields` in the single document fetch (`GET /collections/x/documents/id`) end-point.
- `GET /collections` API endpoint now respects the collections allowed in the API key associated with the request.
- Support for `exclude_fields` in the `GET /collections` API end-point. This is useful when you have a lot of fields which bloats the payload.

**Performance:**

- Implemented lazy filtering of numerical fields which speeds up a subset of searches when `enable_lazy_filter` boolean parameter is enabled.
- Improved working memory used when loading large embedding models.
- **[New in v27.1]** Fixed an important performance regression in evaluation of range filter queries.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a few bugs in the use of conversational search feature on a HA set-up.
- Fixed an edge case in use of `_eval()` along with hybrid search.
- Fixed an edge case in vector query by document ID returning k+1 hits.
- Fixed a bug in the use of `flat_search_cutoff` parameter of vector search that returned suboptimal results.
- Fixed a few bugs and edge cases involving reference fields and joins.
- Fixed wildcard query not excluding un-indexed fields while searching.
- Fixed a crash that occurred while loading collections that's related to indexing a collection not referenced by other collections.
- Fixed an edge case in the sorting clause of `_eval` operation that caused a rare crash.
- Fixed stemming for non-English locales.
- Fixed semantic search faceting happening on the entire result set instead of only on `k` returned docs.
- Fixed geosearch not returning real distances when `precision` parameter was used. 
- Fixed quirks around deletion of analytics event rules.
- Fixed an issue with deletion & update of array reference fields.
- Return `store` field property in collection schema response.
- Fixed a hanging issue when OpenAI API returned no response.
- Fixed persistence of `range_index` and `stem` field properties.
- Fixed highlighting of text stored in fields inside array of objects.
- Fix `_vector_query` parameter in `sort_by` clause being treated as a sorting field.
- Fix overrides not working with semantic search.
- Fixed a regression in v26 that prevented an empty array from being used as a valid value in filter_by clause.
- Fix `return_id` not being returned in import API response during failures.
- **[New in v27.1]** When infix search does not find highlight, use normal search.
- **[New in v27.1]** Don't return error if `limit_hits` threshold is breached. Instead, just return empty results.
- **[New in v27.1]** Add guard for non-indexed default sorting field.
- **[New in v27.1]** Fix OpenAI error handling during conversation model init.
- **[New in v27.1]** Fixed usage of `distance_threshold` parameter for inner product vector distance.
- **[New in v27.1]** Fixed and improved validation for analytics rules and events.
- **[New in v27.1]** Fixed an edge case with scoped API key usage with joins. 
- **[New in v27.1]** Fixed prefix highlighting bugs that occurred due to use of stemming.
- **[New in v27.1]** Initialize analytics db store only if analytics dir is given. We will create a directory if it does not exist.
- **[New in v27.1]** Fixed exporting regression that prevented embedding fields, joined fields and non-schema fields from being exported.
- **[New in v27.1]** Fixed `geo_distance_meters` returning values in `km` / `mi`.

### Deprecations / behavior changes

**Analytics directory**

We now require the `analytics-dir` flag to be provided for using analytics features.  

```bash
./typesense-server --data-dir=/path/to/data --api-key=abcd \
  --enable-search-analytics=true \
  --analytics-dir=/path/to/analytics-data \ 
  --analytics-flush-interval=60
```

**Conversational Search:**

To address some limitations that we found with the previous design of the conversational search feature, 
we now use a Typesense collection for storing the conversation history. 

During upgrade, we will attempt to create a 
default collection with the name `ts_conversation_history_model_id` and migrate existing conversations 
to this collection. 

**However,** given the edge cases we found and have now fixed with the new approach on multi-node Highly Available 
clusters, this automated migration may not work: if it does not, please refer to the guide on how to 
[re-create the conversation model](https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/conversational-search-rag.html).

**Exhaustive `total_values` in facet stats**

We refactored the faceting data structures to improve efficiency. This had an impact on how the `total_values` in
`facet_stats` is computed for low-cardinality facet fields: it's now computed only within the
results returned, instead of on the whole dataset. 

To get an accurate `total_values` for the entire dataset, send this additional search parameter:

```json
{
  "facet_strategy": "exhaustive"
}
```

This will force Typesense to compute facets in an exhaustive manner and allows the `total_values` key in the response to be exact.

## Upgrading

Before upgrading your existing Typesense cluster to v{{ $page.typesenseVersion }}, please review the behavior
changes above to prepare your application for the upgrade.

We'd recommend testing on your development / staging environments before upgrading. 

### Typesense Cloud

If you're on Typesense Cloud:

1. Go to [https://cloud.typesense.org/clusters](https://cloud.typesense.org/clusters).
2. Click on your cluster
3. Click on "Cluster Configuration" on the left-side pane, and then click on "Modify"
4. Select a new Typesense Server version in the dropdown
5. Schedule a time for the upgrade.

### Self Hosted

If you're self-hosting Typesense, here's how to upgrade:

#### Single node deployment

1. Trigger a snapshot to [create a backup](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/cluster-operations.html#create-snapshot-for-backups) of your data, for safety purposes.
2. Stop Typesense server.
3. Replace the binary via the tar package or via the DEB/RPM installer. 
4. Start Typesense server back again.

#### Multi-node deployment

To upgrade a multi-node cluster, we will be proceeding node by node to ensure the cluster remains healthy during the rolling upgrade.

**NOTE:** During the upgrade, we have to ensure that the leader of the cluster is using the **older** Typesense version. 
So we will upgrade the leader last. You can determine whether a node is a leader or follower by the value of the `state` 
field in the `/debug` end-point response.

| State | Role     |
|-------|----------|
| 1     | LEADER   |
| 4     | FOLLOWER |

1. Trigger a snapshot to [create a backup](https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/cluster-operations.html#create-snapshot-for-backups) of your data 
   on the leader node.
2. On any follower, stop Typesense and replace the binary via the tar package or via the DEB/RPM installer.
3. Start Typesense server back again and wait for node to rejoin the cluster as a follower and catch-up (`/health` should return healthy). 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the other _followers_, leaving the leader node uninterrupted for now.
5. Once all followers have been upgraded to v{{ $page.typesenseVersion }}, stop Typesense on the leader.
6. The other nodes will elect a new leader and keep working. 
7. Replace the binary on the old leader and start the Typesense server back again. 
8. This node will re-join the cluster as a follower, and we are done.


## Downgrading

If you wish to downgrade back to an earlier version of Typesense server, you can safely downgrade to either `v26` or `v0.25.x`.
